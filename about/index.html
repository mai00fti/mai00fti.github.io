I'm a bioinformatician working the field of Gene Annotation - with a special focus on non-protein coding RNA genes.
I have a diploma and a PhD in Computer Science both concentrating on non-protein coding RNA genes. 
I developed the tools <a href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~jana/software/RNAmicro.html" target="_blank"><code>RNAmicro</code></a>, 
<a href="http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/snoReport/" target="_blank"><code>SnoReport</code></a>, 
<a href="http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/GotohScan/GotohScan_2.0-alpha.tar.gz"><code>GotohScan</code></a>, and most recently
<a href="http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/ePoPE/" target="_blank"><code>ePoPE</code></a>
While <em>RNAmicro</em> and <em>SnoReport</em> are programs that predict novel miRNAs and snoRNAs, 
resp. using the Support Vector Machine as their machine learning approach;  <code>GotohScan</code> implements an 
efficient variant of Gotoh's semi-global alignment algorithm <a href="http://jaligner.sourceforge.net/references/gotoh1982.pdf" target="_blank">[Gotoh(1982)]</a>. 
<code>ePoPE</code> is a dynamic programming approach to identify the last common ancestor and the history of the evolution of paralogs 
of a set of related genes given a phylogenetic tree.

  Currently, I work as a post-doctoral researcher in the Bioinformatics Group of Peter Stadler at the Department of Computer Sciene 
  of the University of Leipzig, Germany. I am giving lectures, seminars and lab courses; and supervise a number of master and 
  PhD students.

<p class="text">In my spare time I do some data analytics in dental medicine, develop web pages and databases. I further develop some artwork for advertising purpose - like impressive flyers, katalogs, accessoires using Adobe's Photoshop and Corel's Graphic Suite. </p>
