I'm a bioinformatician working the field of Gene Annotation - with a special focus on non-protein coding RNA genes.
I have a diploma and a PhD in Computer Science both concentrating on non-protein coding RNA genes. 
I developed the tools [RNAmicro](http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~jana/software/RNAmicro.html), 
[SnoReport](http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/snoReport/), 
[GotohScan](http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/GotohScan/GotohScan_2.0-alpha.tar.gz), and most recently
[ePoPE](http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/ePoPE/). 
While <em>RNAmicro</em> and <em>SnoReport</em> are programs that predict novel miRNAs and snoRNAs, 
resp. using the Support Vector Machine as their machine learning approach;  <code>GotohScan</code> implements an 
efficient variant of Gotoh's semi-global alignment algorithm [Gotoh(1982)](http://jaligner.sourceforge.net/references/gotoh1982.pdf).

  Now I work as a post-doctoral researcher in the Bioinformatics Group of Peter Stadler at the Department of Computer Sciene 
  of the University of Leipzig, Germany. I am giving lectures, seminars and lab courses; and supervise a number of master and 
  PhD students.
