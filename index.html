		'A','C','G' and 'U' - are letters? True. Is it all? NO! 
		Hundreds to millions of these "letters" build up the area of work I most enjoy: 
		digging deep into the meaning, function, evolution and structural appearance of RNA sequences - 
		biological macro molecules that sit inside each and every cell of our - and all other's bodies. 
		Tiny stuff that controls almost everything.. 
		
		This work is not just number/letter chrunching sometimes it collecting massive amounts of data to analyse 
		the evolution of RNA genes [a href="publications/index.html#2">1</a>,a href="publications/index.html#2">17</a>,
		a href="publications/index.html#2">23</a>,a href="publications/index.html#2">24</a>] and then it is finding the 
		<i>Hairpins in a Haystack</i> [<a href="publications/index.html#2">2</a>]. On other days, I need to develop new 
		algorithms to adress a problem like the prediction of the evolution [a href="publications/index.html#2">23</a>].<br>
		&rarr; Have a look at my <a href="/publications/">publications</a> to get a detailed overview of all my work projects.
